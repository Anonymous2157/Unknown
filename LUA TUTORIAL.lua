# Hi! This is a tutorial for how to code with lua! Let us use lua for math.

lua> 2 + 2 
# This command shows the answer to 2 + 2, which is 4!
# You can do this with other numbers. Let me give you another example!
  lua> 44 + 505
  
  # This will also tell you the answer!
  # But you can also use it for other equations.
  
  lua> 500 * 500
  
  # The Sign for Multiplication is different, instead of a X. It is a asterisk's.
  # Let us say that you want to use Parantheses and Order of Operation for Lua.
  
  lua> (224 * 3) + 6 - 33
  
  # You can do that too. You can do the same thing without parantheses.
      
      lua> 224 * 3 + 6 - 33
      
      # What, we have done is we used Lua for math! Lua is a program that can be used for math, but that is not all of the features of Lua. We only have done a little.
      # I will see you for Lua Again!
